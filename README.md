### Project details
Team name: Natalino BUSA
Project name: EHMS - Enhanced Hostel Meal System

### Motivation
Students living in NUS Campus have fixed dedicated meal plans which results in food wastage and underutilised credits. 
 
Students’ perspective:
Student residents are expected to pay a fixed amount of money to stay in their colleges/ halls at the start of the Semester. However, from past experiences, many students have underutilized credits at the time when they finished the Semester. 
 
School/ Food Caterer’s perspective:
The money that colleges or halls had received from students gave them the responsibility that a certain amount of food needs to be produced so as to accommodate meals to all the students living in the area, which includes weekends and recess week period. Many times during weekend or recess week, students choose to return home and hence they do not consume their meals even when they are entitled to, hence this leads to food wastage.
 
Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the amount of food waste generated has grown by around 30% over the last 10 years. 763 million kg of food waste was generated in 2018 – that’s the weight of more than 54,000 double decker buses.

### Aim
We hope to enable NUS staffs, students and resident advisors living in UTown College Programme and Halls of Residences to have greater flexibility in opting for their meals and aid NUS towards becoming a zero food wastage campus.
